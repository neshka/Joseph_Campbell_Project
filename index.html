 			<h4>One of Campbell's most identifiable, most quoted and arguably most misunderstood sayings was his admonition to <i>follow your bliss</i>.</h4>
 			<h4>He saw this not merely as a mantra, but as a helpful guide to the individual along the hero journey that each of us walks through life:</h4>
 		</div>
 		<br>
		<div style="background:orange;">
			<p>			
				<h4><b><i>If you follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you,</i></b></h4>
				<h4><b><i>and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living.</i></b></h4>
				<h4><b><i>Wherever you are, if you are following your bliss, you are enjoying that refreshment,</i></b></h4>
				<h4><b><i>that life within you, all the time</i></b>.</h4>
